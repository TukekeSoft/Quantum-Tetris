The biggest and most important promise of the future capability of quantum computing is unprecedented machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Above is music composed by a program executed on a quantum computer (written by James Weaver).  This is where the interests of the biggest companies like Microsoft and Google lie.

James Wootton is the most prominent advocate and pioneer for quantum computing.  He proudly announces in the article above that he has realized the first game on a quantum computer.  He summarizes it as an alternate version of rock-paper-scissors, and explains that it highlights the capabilities of each single qubit in a quantum processor.  Each of the four opponents, as a matter of fact, *is* a single qubit.
