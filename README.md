##  Quantum Tetris

Quantum Tetris is your traditional tetris game which has several twists based on the concepts of quantum computing. Additionally, to implement this quantum functionality it uses IBM's qiskit library found [here](https://qiskit.org) which runs in the cloud on IBM's quantum computers.

To play our game you can go here: http://quantumtetris.com

To view our GoDot project you can go here: https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/GoDot-Quantum-Tetris

Backend can accessed via https://q-tetris-backend.herokuapp.com/

## Architecture

The architecture of our project consists of a backend flask server that uses a PostgreSQL database to hold our player info. Our frontend is a simple html webpage that uses various graphics libraries to implement changes. We use GoDot to run our game in browser.

## Setup
### Git setup
* Navigate to desired directory
```
git init
git clone https://github.com/dartmouth-cs98/Quantum-Tetris.git
cd Quantum-Tetris/
```
### Dev Environmental Setup Notes
#### Conda
* The easiest way to manage all of our packages that we will need is with a Conda environment.
* If you don't have one yet, you can set one up [here](https://anaconda.org/)
* Once you set up your conda environment run the following commandsm using your chosen name in place of %NAMEOFENV%.
```
conda create -n %NAMEOFENV% python=3
conda activate %NAMEOFENV%
conda update --name base conda
conda install python==3.7
python3 -m pip install --user qiskit
```
###### Note:
If you get an error regarding an "ssl" error run the following commands
```
brew uninstall openssl
brew install openssl
```

If you get an error trying to run the server in Pycharm like "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'" ensure than the folder "server" is marked as a source root

#### PyCharm
* If you wish to dev this project in PyCharm, follow the following instructions if not ignore.
* Within PyCharm go to `Pycharm -> Preferences -> Project:[ProjectName] -> Project Interpreter`
* Then click on the `gear icon` on the top right and click `Add Local`. Navigate to the file `/anaconda3/envs/[ProjectName]/bin/python3.7`
* Click on this file and click add
* Additionally to set the environmental variable that you will need. go to `Pycharm -> Click on file name next to the green run button -> Edit configurations -> Click the ... to the left of the environmental variables dropdown -> add the following 2 environemntal variables DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/quantum_tetris and APP_SETTINGS= config.DevelopmentConfig `

### How to Set Up Front End
* Navigate to the `webapp` directory
* Run the following commands
* Yarn will continue to run in the terminal, so start a new terminal or window to run additional commands.
```
yarn
yarn start
```

### How to Set Up Backend
* Navigate to the `server` directory
* Make sure you have python3 installed if not install it [here]( https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Also for local devving you will need to run a postgresql database in the background. The easiest way to set this up would be to follow the instructions found [here](https://postgresapp.com/)
* For the Postgress the server make sure the server is running on port 5432 (the default) and is named `quantum_tetris`
* Run the following command in the `server` directory
```
./setup.sh
```

## Deployment

#### Front end
* To deploy any local changes to surge, you can type `yarn deploy` while in the `webapp` directory
#### Back end
* To deploy any local changes to heroku, you can type `yarn heroku` while in the project's root directory.
* *Since the heroku URL is used in the GoDot game export, it is impossible to have full integration locally. Test all changes to the backend via Postman and use the above command to deploy to heroku*
